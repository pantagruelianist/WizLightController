This is a project that I am working on personally to better investigate topics that are pertinent to my job. I learned that the Wiz lights are able to build json packets on device and send them over UDP. Cool. Going to play with this once a week or so.
I'm going to see if I can tie this to music or something, not too sure yet. Should be fun.
